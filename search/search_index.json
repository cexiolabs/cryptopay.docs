Upon creating a key you will have 3 pieces of information which you must remember: Key - Randomly generated and provided by CryptoPay Secret - Randomly generated and provided by CryptoPay Passphrase - Provided by you to further secure your API access. CryptoPay stores the salted hash of your passphrase for verification, but cannot recover the passphrase if you forget it. API Key Permissions You can restrict the functionality of API keys. Before creating the key, you must choose what permissions you would like the key to have. The permissions are: Merchant permission Allows a key manage your sub-merchants. Order permission Allows a key to enter orders, as well as retrieve order data. This includes POST /order and several GET endpoints. View permission Allows a key read permissions. This includes most of GET endpoints. Please refer to documentation below to see what API key permissions are required for a specific route. Creating a Request All REST requests must contain the following headers: CP-ACCESS-KEY The api key as a string. CP-ACCESS-SIGN The base64-encoded signature (see Signing a Message). CP-ACCESS-TIMESTAMP A timestamp for your request. CP-ACCESS-PASSPHRASE The passphrase you specified when creating the API key. All request bodies should have content type application/json and be valid JSON. Signing a Message The CP-ACCESS-SIGN header is generated by creating a sha256 HMAC using the base64-decoded secret key on the prehash string timestamp + method + requestPath + body (where + represents string concatenation) and base64-encode the output. The timestamp value is the same as the CP-ACCESS-TIMESTAMP header. The body is the request body string or omitted if there is no request body (typically for GET requests). The method should be UPPER CASE like \"GET\", \"POST\", etc. Note Do not forget to base64-decode the alphanumeric secret string (resulting in 64 bytes) before using it as the key for HMAC. Also, base64-encode the digest output before sending in the header.

Decimal values are allowed. Your timestamp must be within 30 seconds of the api service time or your request will be considered expired and rejected. We recommend using the time endpoint to query for the API server time if you believe there many be time skew between your server and the API servers. Rate limit The API server will return a 429 response (Too Many Requests) if you have spent your allowance completely. TBD: what is limit? General rules All endpoints return either a JSON object or array. Data is returned in ascending order. Oldest first, newest last. All time and timestamp related fields are in ISO 8601 . For GET endpoints, parameters must be sent as a query string . For POST, PUT, and DELETE endpoints, the parameters are sent in the request body with content type application/json .
